            <p className='Inside-Poster3-Mobile-Text'>As quickly as the mountain bike arrived, so did the issue of trail access. By 1987, bikes were getting the boot from public lands. That year, we took part in a round table of advocacy groups, and within six months, the International Mountain Bike Association (IMBA) was born. In short order, we became trail access evangelists. We sponsored the first industry-wide meeting on the subject, and some of our employees went to sit on IMBA’s board. Without trail advocates, there’d be no trails to protect. It’s as simple as that.</p>
